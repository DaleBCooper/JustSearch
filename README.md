# Swiss Army Search 

This app is an Assist replacement (the app that launches after long pressing home). 
It provides a simple way to search from everywhere without needing to launch the heavyweight (in data and resources' needs) Google search app.

## Usage
As an assist app, SAS cannot be launched via the launcher. Users need to navigate to the device settings and change the default Assist app.

## Contributing 
Swiss Army Search only supports duckduckgo, with support for other providers planned, as well as showing installed apps so that you don't have to first go to home to search for them.
