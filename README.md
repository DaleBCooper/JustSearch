# Swiss Army Search

SAS is an Assist replacement (the app that launches after long pressing home). 
It provides a simple way to search from everywhere without needing to launch the heavy (in terms of data and resources' needs) Google search app.

## Usage
As an assist app, SAS cannot be launched via the launcher. Users need to navigate to the device settings and change the default Assist app.

## Contributing 
SAS uses DuckDuckGo by default, but allows opting for Google, Bing, Yandex or Yahoo instead.
